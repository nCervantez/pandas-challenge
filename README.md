# Future School Budget and Priority Report

## Overview of Report

I am the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Tasks

- District Summary
  
- School Summary
  
- Highest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
  
- Lowest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing
  
- Math Scores by Grade
  
- Reading Scores by Grade
  
- Scores by School Spending
  
- Scores by School Size
  
- Scores by School Type
  
## PyCity Schools Analysis
The analysis performed today takes a district of schools and the test scores by student from these schools, and offers an in depth comparison of these schools based on school type, school size, and budget per student. Based on the analysis of the data from the district it is clear to see that Charter schools are more likely to have a student with passing grades than a District School. However, this does not translate to the budget per student, as there is only one charter school in the second highest budget bin, and half of all charter schools in the lowest budget bin. What it does show is that school size is a much more important factor to consider, as all but one charter school are in the Medium to Small school size range, while all District schools are in the Large school size range. The spending summary Data Frame shows a downward trend on all test scores as spending increases, while the size summary Data Frame shows a sharp drop in test scores as schools move from Medium to Large size, further showcasing the fact that school size is a much more important factor to consider when comparing test score.
