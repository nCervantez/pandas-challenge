# Future School Budget and Priority Report

## PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook Analysis


### Overview of Analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, I will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Tasks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

  Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
  Include the following:

  -  Total number of unique schools
    
  -  Total students
    
  -  Total budget
    
  -  Average math score
    
  -  Average reading score
    
  -  % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    
  -  % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    
  -  % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
- The second task is to create a 'School Summary'

  Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
  Include the following:

  -  School name
    
  -  School type
    
  -  Total students
    
  -  Total school budget
    
  -  Per student budget
    
  -  Average math score
    
  -  Average reading score
    
  -  % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    
  -  % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    
  -  % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

- The third task is to create two DataFrames highlighting the top and bottom 5 schools by overall passing percentage.
