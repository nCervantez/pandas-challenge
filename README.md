# Pandas Challenge
## PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook


### Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this notebook is to provide the means for an in depth analysis of schools in a district, by creating data frames that will compare test scores per school based on school type, school size, and per student budget.

### Main Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Python, Pandas, and JupyterLab, CSV files with data for a school district are read into Pandas DataFrames. A district summary is created that showcases the number of schools, the total budget, and a snapshot of average test scores and percent passing for math and reading for the district as a whole. Using the DataFrame, a seperate Data Frame is created that will show the average test scores and percent passing for math and reading, a per student budget, the total budget for the school and the number of students in the school, for each school in the district. We will filter the created DataFrame to show the top 5 schools by overall passing percentage, as well as the bottom 5 schools by overall passing percentage. Using the original data another DataFrame will be created to show the percentage of students passing math and reading by grade, per school. Another DataFrame will also be created that will sort the schools by school size, and budget per student. Using these DataFrames, we will create a DataFrame that will compare students test scores by the size of the school they attend. Finally, one last DataFrame will be created that will compare all test score averages, and percentage of students passing, by the type of school they attend.
