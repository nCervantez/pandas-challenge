# Pandas Challenge
## PyCitySchools Jupyter Notebook


### Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this notebook is to provide the means for an in depth analysis of schools in a district, by creating data frames that will compare test scores per school based on school type, school size, and per student budget.

### Main Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Python, Pandas, and JupyterLab, CSV files with data for a school district are read into Pandas DataFrames. A district summary is created that showcases the number of schools, the total budget, and a snapshot of average test scores and percent passing for math and reading. Using the DataFrame, more DataFrames are created by filtering the data based on a few criteria.
